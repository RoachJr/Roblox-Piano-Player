Simply paste in the sheet of the song you want to play, adjust the key delay to you liking, and play!


Steps to install:

2. Download the Roblox Piano EXE file.
3. Paste in the music sheet.
4. Adjust the key delay to your liking.

(to play instruments on games like wild west, make sure you remove ALL spaces in the music so nothing screws up, if it is not then you are fine.)
